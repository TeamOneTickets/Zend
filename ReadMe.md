Zend Framework Library
===

As big users of [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/) we include it as a submodule in all of our projects. Unfortunately, Zend Framework 1.x is still in Subversion.

Thereâ€™s a few people out there mirroring the Zend Framework in Git via several different methods. Most are hosting full mirrors, but we only need the main library.

This repo is simply **just** the `library/Zend/` folder of the *latest tagged release*., currently 1.11.10.
