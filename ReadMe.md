Zend Framework Library (1.11.14)
===

As big users of [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/) we include it as a submodule in all of our projects. Unfortunately, Zend Framework 1.x is still in Subversion.

There’s a few people out there mirroring the Zend Framework in Git via several different methods. Most are hosting full mirrors, but we only need the main library.

This repo is simply **just** the `library/Zend/` folder of the *latest tagged release*, currently 1.11.14.

We haven’t altered it any way other than to just slim it down to just the library portion. We do not import the history, just the “snapshot” of each release. If you want the history then you should get that from [the official Zend Framework SVN repo](http://framework.zend.com/svn/).

License

Being that this is just a mirror of the official Zend Framework SVN repo it is covered under their [New BSD License](http://framework.zend.com/license).


Updates
===
Use this at your own risk, but since we use Zend Framework throughout all of our own [Team One Tickets](http://www.teamonetickets.com/) projects we plan to keep it updated. Each official release will be tagged with the release number.
